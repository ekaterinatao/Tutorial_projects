## Description
We should perform descriptive statistics with hypothesis testing of tennis dataset.  

## Aim
To test some hypothesis and perform analytics of tennis data.  

**Briefing**  
- There are datasets since 1973 to 2022.
- We should use data since 1980 to 2022 only in single matches.
- We should perform descriptive statistics and check some hypothesis. 

**Skills**  
Learn to write good code.  
Train EDA and hypothesis testing.
