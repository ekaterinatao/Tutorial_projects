## Description
We should perform descriptive statistics with hypothesis testing of dataset containing information of Spatial Omics.  

## Aim
To test some hypothesis, perform bootstrap and permutation tests of omics data.  

**Briefing**  
- There is dataset containing information of Spatial Omics.
- We should perform descriptive statistics and check some hypothesis.
- We should realize algorithm of bootstrap and permutation tests.  

**Skills**  
Learn to write good code.  
Train EDA and hypothesis testing.  
Train to write bootstrap and permutation tests code.  

## Datasets
You can find original dataset in the project folder.   

**Parameters**
cell_type;  
cell_interaction;  
age_group;  
distance_to_vasculature;  
distance_to_largest_cell;  
immune_marker_1;  
immune_marker_2;  
area_of_cell;  
case_id.  

## Results
- Bootstrap and permutation tests were performed on your own.  
- You can find all hypothesis, explanations and conclusions in the main [notebook](https://github.com/ekaterinatao/Tutorial_projects/blob/main/project_9/HW9_Tao_Ekaterina.ipynb).
