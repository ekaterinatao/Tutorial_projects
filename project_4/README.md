## Description
Merging 3 datasets and perform data preprocessing and analytics.

## Aim
Data preprocessing and analytics in correctly merged dataset.

**Briefing**  
- There are 3 datasets with different shapes and variables.
- We need to search for common features and corectly perform merging.
- We need to perform data preprocessing and analytics in each single dataset and in merged one.
- We should make conclusions about data and it's differencies.

**Skills**  
Learn to write good code.  
Train Pandas skills.  
Train visualisation skills.

## Datasets
You can find original datasets either in the project folder or using links at the beginning of the notebook.

## Results
- At the beginning of the notebook all needed functions are presented.
- Common features were renamed and datasets were concatinated using 'inner' method.
- Rows containing more than 2 nans were removed.
- Duplicates were removed.
- Checking for outliers was performed using 3-sigm rule. Outliers were removed.
- Different types of visualisation were performed.
